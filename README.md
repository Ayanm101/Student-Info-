A Guide to Student Information (Java)
- A program that gives a list of information about two students at the University of Minnesota. I'm planning on adding more features to the program that may include more information for prepective students. Maybe more about the courses they are taking, How they rate their Proffesors, etc.  
- I used inheritance to ensure that any changes to information does'nt cause a chain reaction of errors to the program. That way for example, instead of including grades, I could include GPA and easily change the variables.
